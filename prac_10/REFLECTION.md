# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Fairly accurate within a few minutes usually, 
I tend to take my time while coding so speed was never really a consideration for me.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I think I got better at estimating how long something would take me, not whether I am faster at doing it.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

Complications can cause the estimates to vary wildly, and 
you should increase your estimates to be higher than you expect to give yourself more time. 

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I make a fem small mistakes a lot, especially when it comes to docstrings and variable names.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

There is a common issue with docstrings and commits either being inconsistent or nonexistent, 
I think many people have a lack or care for the finer details of their code.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[JaanVee Code Review](https://github.com/Jaanvee-Danhawoor/cp1404practicals/pull/5)

### Explanation

The review was difficult due to minor issues, mainly inconsistencies in docstrings and a lack of comments for 
ambiguous code. Instead of labeling these as wrong, I gently reminded them about the missing the docstrings and 
how comment could be useful there. I also said their code was good.

### Good Code Review 2

[Nicknlowe Code Review](https://github.com/nicknlowe/cp1404practicals/pull/3)

### Explanation

In this code review I told the user that they had missed doing their estimate times and 
I highlighted a possible change to their code for reducing their maintenance burden, 
I also complemented their code as it was good as well.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Overall I'm not a big fall of large walls of text, but I understand that may not be possible in this subject. 
Another issue is the inability to get code reviews and feedback at decent times and my most recent PR came back 
2 weeks after submission.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I like to think i got good at list comprehension, as well as time management where it really counted 
especially during and after the sprint.
